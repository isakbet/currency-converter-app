# currency-exchange-app

This project was part of Altcademy's ReactJS Development course and required me to build a currency exchange rate listing site. 
It allows users to convert one currency to another. 
Users can enter an amount, select the actual currency, select the desired currency and then the app fetch the exchange rate from the Frankfurter API.
